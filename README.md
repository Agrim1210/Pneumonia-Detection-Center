Pediatric chest X-rays are harder to properly acquire and standardize when compared to adults, as for a children in a dark room, with people watching them from a glass window with strange machinery doesn't make for a comfortable experience.
At the same time, children present a different physiology that is important to be captured in X-ray classification algorithms, as most datasets tend to focus on adults only.
